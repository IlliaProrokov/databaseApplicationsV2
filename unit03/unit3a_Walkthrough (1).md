# Unit 3a Walkthrough — Redundancy

**Read this first. Then open `unit3a_lastname.md` and do the work.**

## What you're doing today

Unit 2 was about getting data *out* of tables somebody else designed. Unit 3 is about deciding what the tables should be in the first place. Today you look at a database that was designed badly on purpose, find what's wrong with it, and see the fixed version.

**Files:** `datasets/denormalized_demo.db` in DB Browser for SQLite. No new SQL today — everything you need is from Unit 2.

## One table, everything in it

Open `denormalized_demo.db` and look at the **Browse Data** tab for the table `games_flat`. Every row is one game, and every row has the home team's name, city, state, conference, and division typed in — and then the away team's too.

```
game_date   home_team            home_city  home_state  away_team      away_city
2025-10-21  Cleveland Cavaliers  Cleveland  Ohio        Chicago Bulls  Chicago
2025-10-24  Cleveland Cavaliers  Cleveland  Ohio        Miami Heat     Miami
2025-10-27  Boston Celtics       Boston     Massachusetts  Cleveland Cavaliers  Cleveland
```

The fact "the Cavaliers play in Cleveland, Ohio" is typed into this table **over thirty times**. That is **redundancy** — the same fact stored in more than one place.

The 30 teams, their cities, states, conferences, and divisions are real. The games and scores are made up.

---

## Why redundancy hurts — three anomalies

An **anomaly** is something that goes wrong because of how the table is designed. There are three, and you need to know them by name.

**Update anomaly** — a fact changes, so you have to change it everywhere it's stored. If the Cavaliers moved to a new city, every one of those thirty-plus rows needs editing. Miss one, and the table now disagrees with itself.

**Insert anomaly** — you want to store a fact but there's nowhere to put it. A brand-new expansion team has a city and a state, but `games_flat` only has rows for *games*. Until the team plays, its city can't be stored anywhere.

**Delete anomaly** — you delete one thing and lose another by accident. Delete every game a team played, and the team's city, state, conference, and division are gone too. Nobody meant to delete the team.

---

## Some rows are already wrong

Some rows in `games_flat` were typed wrong on purpose. Two of them are in Cavaliers games. In one row the Cavaliers' team name is misspelled. In another row the state is typed as `OH` instead of `Ohio`. Here is how a mistake like that shows up.

Count the Cavaliers' games by **team name**. Run this in the **Execute SQL** tab:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM   games_flat
WHERE  home_team = 'Cleveland Cavaliers'
   OR  away_team = 'Cleveland Cavaliers';
```
```
COUNT(*)
32
```

Now count the same games by **city** instead:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM   games_flat
WHERE  home_city = 'Cleveland'
   OR  away_city = 'Cleveland';
```
```
COUNT(*)
33
```

Both queries are asking "how many games did the Cavaliers play?" They should give the same answer. They don't. The city count is 33 because 33 games really have Cleveland in them. The name count is 32 because in one of those games the team name is misspelled, so `= 'Cleveland Cavaliers'` doesn't match it. The database didn't complain — it just gave a wrong answer.

That is what redundancy does over time. The more places a fact is typed, the more places it can be typed wrong. Every extra copy is one more chance for a typo, and a typo means every query that filters on that column quietly skips that row.

**Finding the bad rows.** `SELECT DISTINCT` lists each different value in a column once. It is the fastest way to spot a typo:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT home_team FROM games_flat ORDER BY home_team;
```

There are 30 teams, so this should return 30 names. It returns 32 — so two names are spelled wrong. Look down the list near Cleveland. The misspelled Cavaliers name sorts right next to the correct one, so it's easy to see. (The other wrong name is part of your task.)

Do the same for the state columns. Check **both** `home_state` and `away_state` — a mistake can be on either side of a game, and the `OH` row is only in one of them.

Once you know the wrong value, find the row:

```sql
SELECT game_id, game_date, home_team, away_team
FROM   games_flat
WHERE  home_team = 'the misspelled name you found'
   OR  away_team = 'the misspelled name you found';
```

---

## The fix: store each fact once

The same database has two more tables, `teams` and `games`. Look at them in Browse Data.

**`teams`** — one row per team. The city is stored here, once.

```
team_id  full_name            city       state  conference  division
6        Cleveland Cavaliers  Cleveland  Ohio   East        Central
```

**`games`** — one row per game. No team names, no cities. Just the team's ID number.

```
game_id  game_date   home_team_id  away_team_id  home_pts  away_pts
73       2025-11-08  6             11            109       98
```

Game 73 is the Cavaliers (team 6) at home against team 11. To find out who team 11 is, you look it up in `teams` — that's the Houston Rockets.

The city is in **one row** of `teams`. Each game just points at the team by number — `home_team_id` and `away_team_id` are **foreign keys** to `teams.team_id`, exactly like the ones you joined on in Unit 2f.

Now moving the Cavaliers is a one-row edit. A new team can be added before it plays. Deleting games can't delete a team.

Splitting tables so every fact lives in exactly one place is called **normalization**. That's what the rest of this unit is about.

## One new thing: joining the same table twice

To show both team *names* for a game, you need `teams` twice — once for the home side, once for the away side. Give each copy its own alias:

```sql
SELECT g.game_date, h.full_name AS home, a.full_name AS away
FROM   games g
JOIN   teams h ON h.team_id = g.home_team_id
JOIN   teams a ON a.team_id = g.away_team_id
LIMIT  5;
```

`h` and `a` are the same table, joined on different columns. This is the last question in today's task.

---

## Now do the work

Open `unit3a_lastname.md`. You'll do the same counts for a different team, find every mistake in `games_flat` (there are more than the two Cavaliers ones), spot the three anomalies in a new table, and write queries on the fixed version. Commit and push when you're done.
